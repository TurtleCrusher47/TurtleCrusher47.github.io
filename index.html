    <h3>A Brief History On Vintage Cards</h3>
    <p id="heh">
        First, there was the WOTC (Wizards of the Coast) era, 
        when cards were manufactured by Wizards of the Coast.
        Sets released in this era include Base Set, Jungle,
        Fossil, Team Rocket, and all Gym and Neo sets.
        While WOTC did manufacture a couple e-series sets, 
        the card design did change and therefore the e-series 
        is usually considered a separate era. Highlights of the 
        WOTC era include 1st Edition Base Set of course, the 
        Neo Shinings, and fantastic artwork and nostalgic card 
        design all around.

        The e-series era introduced scannable cards if you had an
        e-reader for your Game Boy Advance. This era of cards us usually 
        hit or miss with collectors, as many loved the beautiful artwork, 
        but were discouraged by literal barcodes on all cards
        except holos. The e-series includes the famed Crystal cards,
        with Crystal Charizard, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Celebi being 
        highlights.

        The e-series era blended into the EX series era in what 
        is generally considered to be the time when the Pokemon TCG 
        was least popular, from around 2003-2007. However, this does 
        not equate to a dropoff in card quality. The EX series 
        introduced Pokemon-ex, more powerful versions of regular 
        Pokemon. The cards included full holographic borders and 
        artwork, and followed up the Crystals and Neo Shinings as 
        true Ultra Rare cards, usually being 2-3 per booster box. 
        Later EX Series sets included Gold Star cards, which featured 
        Shiny Pokemon and were the first cards to show Pokemon 
        breaking out of the artwork box. These Gold Star cards 
        were incredibly difficult to pull, with one coming in every 
        two to three booster boxes. The EX Series was the longest era 
        to date, spanning four full years and including 16 distinct 
        English sets.
