                        <h4>Wizards of the Coast</h4>
                        <p>
                            First, there was the WOTC (Wizards of the Coast) era, 
                            when cards were manufactured by Wizards of the Coast.
                            Sets released in this era include Base Set, Jungle,
                            Fossil, Team Rocket, and all Gym and Neo sets.
                            While WOTC did manufacture a couple e-series sets, 
                            the card design did change and therefore the e-series 
                            is usually considered a separate era. Highlights of the 
                            WOTC era include 1st Edition Base Set of course, the 
                            Neo Shinings, and fantastic artwork and nostalgic card 
                            design all around.

                    <h4>E-Series</h4>
                    <p>
                        The e-series era introduced scannable cards if you had an
                        e-reader for your Game Boy Advance. This era of cards us usually 
                        hit or miss with collectors, as many loved the beautiful artwork, 
                        but were discouraged by literal barcodes on all cards
                        except holos. The e-series includes the famed Crystal cards,
                        with Crystal Charizard, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Celebi being 
                        highlights.

                    <h4>EX series</h4>
                    <p>
                        The e-series era blended into the EX series era in what 
                        is generally considered to be the time when the Pokemon TCG 
                        was least popular, from around 2003-2007. However, this does 
                        not equate to a dropoff in card quality. The EX series 
                        introduced Pokemon-ex, more powerful versions of regular 
                        Pokemon. The cards included full holographic borders and 
                        artwork, and followed up the Crystals and Neo Shinings as 
                        true Ultra Rare cards, usually being 2-3 per booster box. 
                        Later EX Series sets included Gold Star cards, which featured 
                        Shiny Pokemon and were the first cards to show Pokemon 
                        breaking out of the artwork box. These Gold Star cards 
                        were incredibly difficult to pull, with one coming in every 
                        two to three booster boxes. The EX Series was the longest era 
                        to date, spanning four full years and including 16 distinct 
                        English sets.

                            The rarest and most expensive pokemon card ever sold was the 1998
                            Japanese Promo Pikachu Illustrator. This card was sold for $5.3 million
                            in July 2021 to the influencer Logan Paul.

                            The reason this card is worth so much is because there are only 39 copies
                            known to be in existence as it was only given out to winners of a pokemon card
                            designing competition in the late 90's.

                        The popularity of the TCG has led to the creation of competitive leagues and tournaments.
                        The Pokemon World Championships is an annual event that brings together the
                        best players from around the world to compete for the title of World Champion.
                        The event has been held annually since 2004 and features both the video game
                        and TCG competitions.

                    <p>
                        In addition to new card sets, the TCG also expanded into the digital realm with the
                        release of the Pokemon Trading Card Game Online in 2011. This allowed players
                        to play against each other in real-time matches and participate in online tournaments.
                        The digital version also allowed for more frequent updates and releases of new card sets,
                        further expanding the possibilities of the game.
