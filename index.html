        <h3 id="History">A Brief History On Vintage Cards</h3>
        <h4>Wizards of the Coast</h4>
        <p>
            First, there was the WOTC (Wizards of the Coast) era, 
            when cards were manufactured by Wizards of the Coast.
            Sets released in this era include Base Set, Jungle,
            Fossil, Team Rocket, and all Gym and Neo sets.
            While WOTC did manufacture a couple e-series sets, 
            the card design did change and therefore the e-series 
            is usually considered a separate era. Highlights of the 
            WOTC era include 1st Edition Base Set of course, the 
            Neo Shinings, and fantastic artwork and nostalgic card 
            design all around.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>E-Series</h4>
            The e-series era introduced scannable cards if you had an
            e-reader for your Game Boy Advance. This era of cards us usually 
            hit or miss with collectors, as many loved the beautiful artwork, 
            but were discouraged by literal barcodes on all cards
            except holos. The e-series includes the famed Crystal cards,
            with Crystal Charizard, Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Celebi being 
            highlights.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>EX series</h4>
            The e-series era blended into the EX series era in what 
            is generally considered to be the time when the Pokemon TCG 
            was least popular, from around 2003-2007. However, this does 
            not equate to a dropoff in card quality. The EX series 
            introduced Pokemon-ex, more powerful versions of regular 
            Pokemon. The cards included full holographic borders and 
            artwork, and followed up the Crystals and Neo Shinings as 
            true Ultra Rare cards, usually being 2-3 per booster box. 
            Later EX Series sets included Gold Star cards, which featured 
            Shiny Pokemon and were the first cards to show Pokemon 
            breaking out of the artwork box. These Gold Star cards 
            were incredibly difficult to pull, with one coming in every 
            two to three booster boxes. The EX Series was the longest era 
            to date, spanning four full years and including 16 distinct 
            English sets.

        <!-- Iconic Cards -->
        <h3 id="Iconic-Cards">Iconic Cards</h3>
        <!-- Pikachu Illustrator -->
        <h4>Pikachu Illustrator</h4>
        <p>
            The rarest and most expensive pokemon card ever sold was the 1998
            Japanese Promo Pikachu Illustrator. This card was sold for $5.3 million
            in July 2021 to the influencer Logan Paul.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The reason this card is worth so much is because there are only 39 copies
            known to be in existence as it was only given out to winners of a pokemon cards
            designing competition in the late 90's.
        </p>
        <!-- First Edition Base Set Shadowless Charizard -->
        <h4>First Edition Charizard</h4>
        <p>
            The most well known pokemon card of all time would be the 1st Edition
            Shadowless Charizard.
        </p>

        <p>
            Featuring one of the most loved and well known pokemon of all time,
            the card is worth around $36 thousand at mint condition.
        </p>
        <!-- Shaymin EX -->
        <h4>Shaymin EX</h4>
        <p>
            The last card I will talk about is iconic not because of its rarity or price,
            but because of how big of an impact it made to the trading card game.
        </p>

        <p>
            The card was released during the roaring skies era and allowed players to fill
            their hand with up till six cards when played.
